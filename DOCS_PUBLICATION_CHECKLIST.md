# Documentation Publication Checklist

## Final Documentation Package

### 1. Core Documentation Files
- [ ] **README.md** - Updated with final fee numbers (1% protocol, 0.05% keeper)
- [ ] **SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete security considerations
- [ ] **SONIC_GAS_ECONOMICS.md** - Gas cost analysis with final numbers
- [ ] **AUDIT_READY_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive audit documentation

### 2. Technical Specifications

#### Fee Structure (Final Numbers)
```
Protocol Fee: 1.0% (100 basis points)
Keeper Fee: 0.05% (5 basis points)
Total Fees: 1.05% of claimed amounts
```

#### Backing Ratio Explanation
```
Backing Ratio = totalSBacking / totalVSSupply

Examples:
- Day 0: 1000 S backing / 1000 vS supply = 1.0 (100% backed)
- Day 30: 1050 S backing / 1000 vS supply = 1.05 (105% backed)
- Day 60: 1100 S backing / 1000 vS supply = 1.10 (110% backed)

The ratio increases over time as fNFTs mature and more S is claimed.
```

### 5. Fee Disclosure Requirements

#### Deposit Page Disclosures
```
⚠️ Fee Notice
When your fNFT matures and S tokens are claimed:
• 1% goes to protocol treasury
• 0.05% goes to keeper who executes claim
• 98.95% backs your vS tokens

Your vS tokens represent proportional claim on vault's S backing.
```

#### Redeem Page Disclosures
```
💡 Redemption Rate
You redeem vS tokens for S at the current backing ratio:
• Current ratio: [1.XX] S per vS token
• This ratio increases over time as more fNFTs mature
• At full maturity: approximately 0.9895 S per vS (after fees)
```
