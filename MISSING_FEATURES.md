# Missing Core Features Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES

### 1. **Vault Integration is Broken**
- **Issue**: Frontend demo doesn't actually use the vault contract
- **Current**: Only demonstrates fNFT minting and claiming
- **Missing**: Actual deposit/redeem functionality with vS tokens
- **Impact**: Users can't test the core value proposition

### 2. **No Vault Funding Mechanism**
- **Issue**: No way to automatically fund the vault with underlying tokens
- **Missing**: Integration between fNFT claims and vault token accumulation
- **Impact**: Redemptions will fail due to insufficient vault balance

### 3. **Incomplete Frontend Integration**
- **Missing Components**:
  - Vault deposit UI
  - vS token redemption interface
  - Real-time vault balance display
  - Integration with actual vault contract addresses

### 4. **No Keeper/Automation System**
- **Issue**: `claimVested()` requires manual triggering
- **Missing**: Automated keeper system for regular claiming
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, tokens remain unclaimed

### 5. **Missing Economic Model**
- **Issue**: No fee structure or revenue model
- **Missing**: Protocol fees, keeper incentives optimization
- **Impact**: Unsustainable economics

## ðŸ”§ INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS

### 1. **No Subgraph Implementation**
- **Missing**: Indexing of vault events and user positions
- **Impact**: Poor frontend performance, no historical data

### 2. **Incomplete Testing Suite**
- **Issue**: `test/vSToken.t.sol` is essentially empty
- **Missing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Impact**: High risk of bugs in production

### 3. **No Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Frontend lacks proper error handling
- **Missing**: User-friendly error messages and retry logic
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during failures

### 4. **Missing Documentation**
- **Issue**: No API documentation or integration guides
- **Missing**: Developer docs, integration examples
- **Impact**: Difficult for others to build on top

## ðŸ“Š MONITORING & ANALYTICS

### 1. **No Health Monitoring**
- **Missing**: Vault health metrics, liquidity ratios
- **Impact**: Cannot detect or prevent system failures

### 2. **No User Analytics**
- **Missing**: User behavior tracking, conversion metrics
- **Impact**: Cannot optimize user experience or product-market fit
