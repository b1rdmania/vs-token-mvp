# vS Vault Risk Disclosure

**Read this before using vS Vault. You could lose money.**

## What vS Vault Does

You give us your locked fNFT worth 1000 S tokens. We give you 990 vS tokens (1% mint fee). You sell vS tokens for cash today. We wait until April 2026, then claim your S tokens.

## Key Risks

### 1. Market Risk - HIGH RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: vS tokens trade at a discount

**Example**: 
- You get 990 vS tokens today (after 1% mint fee)
- Market price: 250 S tokens (75% discount)
- You lose 740 S tokens vs waiting 9 months

**Why This Happens**:
- People want cash now, not later
- Market prices in time value of money
- Supply and demand set the price

**Our Role**: We don't control the price. The market does.

### 2. Liquidity Risk - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: You might not be able to sell vS tokens

**When This Happens**:
- Months 6-9: Few buyers (why buy vS at 95% when S costs 100%?)
- Low trading volume on Shadow DEX
- Big price swings

**Result**: You might be stuck with vS tokens you can't sell

### 3. Smart Contract Risk - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: Code might have bugs

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- Contracts could have security vulnerabilities
- Hackers could exploit the system
- Bugs could lock your tokens

**Our Protection**:
- Professional audit before launch
- Simple, immutable code design
- No admin keys (we can't steal funds)

**Your Risk**: If contracts fail, you lose money

### 4. External Dependency Risk - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: We depend on Sonic's fNFT contract

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- Sonic changes their contract interface
- Their contract has bugs or fails
- Delegation system stops working

**Result**: We might not be able to claim your S tokens

### 5. Redemption Window Risk - LOW RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: You have 6 months to redeem after April 2026

**Timeline**:
- April 15, 2026: Redemption opens (1:1 vS → S, minus 2% fee)
- October 15, 2026: Grace period ends (180 days later)
- After October 15, 2026: Leftover tokens swept to treasury

**Your Risk**: If you don't redeem in time, you lose your tokens

## Fee Structure

- **Mint Fee**: 1% (when depositing fNFT)
- **Redeem Fee**: 2% (when redeeming vS for S)
- **Total Cost**: ~3% for immediate liquidity vs. 9-month wait

**Example**: 1000 S fNFT → 990 vS → ~970 S after redemption

## What We Don't Control

- **Price**: Market determines vS token value, not us
- **Timing**: We follow Sonic's fNFT maturity schedule
- **External Contracts**: We can't fix Sonic's systems if they break
- **Market Conditions**: Trading volume and liquidity depend on users

## What We Do Control

- **Security**: Audited, immutable smart contracts
- **Transparency**: Open source code and clear documentation
- **Fee Structure**: Fixed 1% mint + 2% redeem fees (immutable)

## Before You Use vS Vault

### Ask Yourself:
1. Do I need cash now more than full value in April 2026?
2. Can I afford to lose 50-90% of my token value?
3. Do I understand how market pricing works?
4. Am I comfortable with these risks?

### If You Answer "No" to Any Question:
Don't use vS Vault. Wait for your fNFTs to unlock naturally.

## Legal Disclaimers

- **Your Responsibility**: You decide if this is right for you and accept all risks
- **No Insurance**: No guarantees, insurance, or refunds available
- **Jurisdiction**: Check your local laws - this might be restricted where you live
