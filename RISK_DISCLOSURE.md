# vS Vault Risk Disclosure

**Read this before using vS Vault. You could lose money.**

## What vS Vault Does

You give us your locked NFT worth 1000 S tokens. We give you 1000 vS tokens. You sell vS tokens for cash today. We wait 9 months, then claim your S tokens.

## Risks You Take

### 1. Market Risk - HIGH RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: vS tokens trade at a discount

**Example**: 
- You get 1000 vS tokens today
- Market price: 250 S tokens (75% discount)
- You lose 750 S tokens vs waiting 9 months

**Why This Happens**:
- People want cash now, not later
- Market prices in time value
- Supply and demand set the price

**Our Role**: We don't control the price. The market does.

### 2. Smart Contract Risk - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: Code might have bugs

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- Contracts could have security holes
- Hackers could steal funds
- Bugs could lock your tokens

**Our Protection**:
- Professional audit before launch
- Simple code (fewer bugs)
- Battle-tested patterns
- No admin keys (we can't steal funds)

**Your Risk**: If contracts break, you lose money

### 3. Liquidity Risk - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: You might not be able to sell vS tokens

**When This Happens**:
- Month 6-9: Few buyers (why buy vS at 95% when S costs 100%?)
- Low trading volume
- Big price swings

**Result**: You might be stuck with vS tokens you can't sell

### 4. External Contract Risk - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: We depend on Sonic's fNFT contract

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- Sonic changes their contract
- Their contract has bugs
- Interface stops working

**Result**: We might not be able to claim your S tokens

### 5. Redemption Risk - LOW RISK ⚠️

**The Problem**: You have 6 months to redeem after maturity

**Timeline**:
- Month 9: Redemption opens
- Month 15: Redemption closes
- After Month 15: Leftover tokens get swept

**Your Risk**: If you don't redeem in time, you lose your tokens

## What We Don't Control

### Price
We don't set vS token prices. The market does. We can't promise any specific price.

### Timing
We don't control when Sonic's fNFTs mature. We follow their schedule.

### External Contracts
We don't control Sonic's contracts. If they break, we can't fix them.

### Market Conditions
We don't control trading volumes, liquidity, or demand for vS tokens.

## What We Do Control

### Security
We write secure code. We get audits. We use best practices.

### Transparency
We tell you exactly how everything works. No hidden fees or tricks.

### Immutability
Once deployed, we can't change the contracts. No rug pulls possible.

## Before You Use vS Vault

### Ask Yourself:
1. Do I need cash now more than full value later?
2. Can I afford to lose 50-90% of my token value?
3. Do I understand how this works?
4. Am I comfortable with these risks?

### If You Answer "No" to Any Question:
Don't use vS Vault. Wait for your tokens to unlock naturally.

## Legal Stuff

### No Promises
We don't promise profits. We don't promise specific prices. We don't promise anything will work perfectly.

### Your Responsibility
You decide if this is right for you. You take all the risks. You could lose money.

### No Guarantees
Past performance doesn't predict future results. Test tokens aren't real tokens. Demo results don't guarantee real results.

### Jurisdiction
This might be illegal where you live. Check your local laws.
