# vS Vault Whitepaper

**Turn locked tokens into cash**

## The Problem

Sonic gave users tokens locked in NFTs for 9 months. Users can't spend these tokens. They can't use them in DeFi. They wait 9 months or lose money to penalties.

This wastes $100M+ in locked value.

## Our Solution

We buy your locked NFT. We give you tokens you can sell today.

**How it works:**
1. You give us your NFT worth 1000 S tokens
2. We give you 1000 vS tokens  
3. You sell vS tokens for cash today
4. We wait 9 months, then claim the S tokens

## Why This Works

**For Users:**
- Get cash today instead of waiting
- No penalties - we take the time risk
- Market sets fair price

**For Us:**
- We get S tokens after 9 months
- Users get liquidity now
- Everyone wins

## The Math

**Example Trade:**
- Your NFT: 10,000 S tokens (locked 9 months)
- You get: 10,000 vS tokens today
- You sell: vS tokens at 25% discount = 2,500 S tokens cash
- You gain: 2,500 S tokens today vs 0 S tokens today

**Our Position:**
- We get: 10,000 S tokens in 9 months
- We paid: 2,500 S tokens today
- Our return: 300% APY for taking time risk

## Technical Design

**Smart Contracts:**
- Vault holds your NFTs
- Vault mints vS tokens 1:1 with NFT value
- After 9 months, vault claims all S tokens
- Users can swap vS back to S tokens at 1:1

**Key Features:**
- No admin keys - no one controls the vault
- No upgrades - code never changes  
- No governance - no voting or proposals
- Gas efficient - batch processing prevents attacks

## Economics

**Revenue:**
- 1% fee on redemptions
- 0.05% fee for keepers who harvest tokens

**Costs:**
- Gas for claiming tokens
- Smart contract development

**Profit:**
- Fees from users
- No penalty risk (we wait until maturity)

## Risks

**For Users:**
- vS tokens trade at discount (expected)
- Smart contract bugs (audited)
- Low liquidity in markets

**For Protocol:**
- No economic risk (we never claim early)
- Simple contracts (less bugs)
- Predictable obligations

## Market Size

**Sonic Season 1:**
- 75% of tokens locked in NFTs
- ~$100M total value locked
- 9-month lock period

**Addressable Market:**

## Competition

## Conclusion

vS Vault solves a real problem: locked tokens waste value. We turn locked tokens into liquid tokens. Users get cash today. We get tokens later. Simple.
