# vS Token MVP

## What's Changed (June 2025)
- **Major Update:** The protocol now models Sonic fNFT vesting as a penalty-based, non-linear curve (not linear unlock). All vS minting, redemption, and valuation logic is based on the current claimable S value, which increases as the penalty decays over time. This prevents arbitrage and ensures fair value for all users. All code, UI, and docs have been updated accordingly.

## üöÄ Elevator Pitch
**vS Token** is a DeFi protocol that transforms illiquid, vesting NFTs (fNFTs) from Sonic airdrops into liquid, tradable ERC-20 tokens. By wrapping locked airdrop rewards in a secure vault, users can unlock liquidity, trade, and participate in DeFi while their original rewards vest. **All vS minting and redemption is based on the current claimable S value, using the Sonic penalty curve.**

## üåç The Full Idea

**Problem:**
- Many airdrop rewards (like Sonic's) are distributed as NFTs that vest with a penalty-based, non-linear curve. You can claim at any time, but the amount of S you receive is subject to a penalty that decays linearly over 9 months. This makes them illiquid and hard to price.

**Solution:**
- vS Token lets users deposit their vesting fNFTs into a smart contract vault and receive liquid vS tokens (ERC-20) in return.
- The amount of vS minted is based on the current claimable S value, factoring in the penalty curve.
- vS tokens can be traded, used in DeFi, or redeemed for the underlying S tokens at any time (at the current claimable value, minus fees).
- This unlocks capital efficiency and composability for airdrop recipients, and creates new DeFi opportunities on Sonic.

**User Story:**
- Alice receives a Sonic airdrop as a vesting NFT (fNFT).
- She deposits her fNFT into the vS Vault and receives vS tokens, calculated at the current claimable S value (using the penalty curve).
- Alice can now trade, LP, or use vS tokens in DeFi, instead of waiting for her rewards to vest.
- When she wants to redeem, she can burn her vS tokens for S tokens at the current claimable value, or (optionally) withdraw the fNFT at fair value.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**On-Chain:**
- **Vault (Custom, Penalty-Based):** Holds fNFTs, manages custody, and issues vS tokens as discounted claims on S, using the penalty curve for all calculations.
- **vS Token (ERC-20):** Liquid, tradable token representing claims on the vault's assets, minted/burned only by the vault.
- **Mock contracts:** For local/testnet development and testing.

**Data Layer:**
- **The Graph subgraph:** Indexes vault events (deposits, redemptions, user positions, penalty curve) for analytics and frontend.

**Backend:**
- **Node.js/Express API:** Serves vault data, user positions, and integrates with The Graph, including penalty/claimable value calculations.

**Frontend:**
- **React + RainbowKit + wagmi:** Modern dApp with wallet connect, live vault stats, penalty curve display, and deposit/redeem UI.

## ‚úÖ Project Status (June 2025)
- **Smart contracts and subgraph:** Fully updated for penalty-based, non-linear vesting logic. All events and data structures reflect the current claimable S value and penalty.
- **Backend and frontend:** Scaffolded and ready for integration. Frontend supports wallet connect, vault stats, and deposit/redeem flows. Penalty-curve integration and UI enhancements are the next focus.
- **Next steps:**
  - Integrate penalty-curve logic into the frontend UI and flows
  - Finalize mainnet deployment scripts and environment
  - Deploy the frontend to a live service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) for public access
- **Local development:**
  - See `/frontend`, `/backend`, and contract directories for setup and usage instructions
  - For deployment, follow the updated docs and scripts in the repo
- **Live demo:**
  - To share a live version, deploy the frontend to Vercel, Netlify, or a similar service

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management & Arbitrage Prevention
- All minting and redemption is based on the current claimable S value, using the penalty curve. This prevents users from gaming the system by timing deposits/withdrawals.
- If fNFT withdrawal is allowed, it is always at fair value (current claimable S), so users cannot exploit the protocol for risk-free profit.
- Dynamic fees on redemption and performance can be used to incentivize liquidity and sustain the protocol.
- The protocol tracks the penalty curve and time elapsed for each fNFT, using robust on-chain logic.
- Conservative minting and reserve management ensure the protocol can always honor redemptions, even if many users redeem early.
