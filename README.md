# vS Vault: Instant Liquidity for Vesting NFTs

**vS Vault transforms illiquid vesting NFTs into liquid ERC-20 tokens. Deposit your Sonic fNFT â†’ Get full-value vS tokens â†’ Trade immediately on Shadow DEX.**

**ðŸ”’ Truly Immutable Design: Zero admin control after deployment - operates as pure decentralized infrastructure.**

---

## The Problem & Our Solution

- **Problem:** Sonic's Season 1 airdrop locks 75% of tokens in 9-month vesting NFTs. Users can't access this value for DeFi, trading, or liquidity needs.
- **Solution:** vS Vault lets users deposit their fNFT and receive full-value vS tokens immediately. These tokens can be traded on Shadow DEX at market rates, providing instant liquidity without waiting for vesting.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit fNFT**: User deposits their Sonic vesting NFT into the vault
2. **Get vS Tokens**: Vault mints full-value vS tokens (1000 S fNFT â†’ 1000 vS tokens)
3. **Trade for Liquidity**: User trades vS tokens on Shadow DEX for immediate Sonic tokens
4. **Vault Waits**: Vault holds fNFTs until month 9 maturity (no early claiming, no penalty burns)
5. **1:1 Redemption**: At month 9+, users can redeem vS â†’ S at exactly 1:1 ratio through vault

## Key Features

- **Instant Full Value**: Get 1000 vS tokens for 1000 S fNFT immediately
- **Market-Driven Pricing**: Let the market determine fair discount rates
- **Shadow DEX Integration**: Trade on Sonic's leading DEX with deep liquidity
- **Simple Economics**: No complex vesting tracking or proportional calculations
- **ðŸ”’ Immutable Vault**: Zero admin control - no pause, no owner functions, no rug risk
- **âš¡ Pure Infrastructure**: Works forever without intervention, like a bridge or AMM

## Demo Experience

Our live demo shows the complete user journey:

1. **Mint Demo fNFT**: 1000 tS tokens, 9-month vesting
2. **Deposit to Vault**: Get 1000 vS tokens instantly  
3. **Trade on Shadow DEX**: Swap vS for tS at current market rate
4. **Immediate Liquidity**: Access funds today instead of waiting 9 months

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts
- **ImmutableVault.sol**: Production vault with zero admin control (mainnet)
- **vSVault.sol**: Demo vault with admin functions (testnet only)
- **vSToken.sol**: Standard ERC-20 token representing vault shares
- **DecayfNFT.sol**: Demo vesting NFT with Sonic-style mechanics

### Key Functions
- `deposit(nftId)`: Deposit fNFT and mint full-value vS tokens
- `redeem(amount)`: Burn vS tokens for underlying assets (month 9+)
- Shadow DEX integration for immediate trading

## Economic Model

### Simple & Honest
- **True 1:1 backing**: Every vS token backed by exactly 1 S token at maturity
- **No penalty burns**: Vault waits until month 9, claims at 0% penalty
- **Market efficiency**: Shadow DEX pool handles price discovery during vesting period
- **Guaranteed redemption**: Direct vSâ†’S redemption at 1:1 ratio available at month 9+

### Risk Disclosure
- vS tokens trade at market discount before maturity (typically 20-80% of face value)
- Protocol guarantees 1:1 redemption only at month 9+ maturity
- Market liquidity depends on Shadow DEX pool depth during vesting period
- Early exit via trading means accepting market discount
