# vS Vault — Immediate Liquidity for Locked Tokens

## The Simple Story

**1. Deposit fNFT** → **2. Get vS tokens** → **3. Trade instantly** → **4. Redeem 1:1 at maturity**

### How It Works

1️⃣ **Deposit Your fNFT**
Transfer your vesting NFT to the vault permanently. Get full value immediately.

2️⃣ **Receive vS Tokens**
Vault mints **99%** of face value as vS tokens (1% mint fee).
*Example: 1,000 S locked → 990 vS in your wallet*

3️⃣ **Trade Immediately**
Swap vS for cash on Shadow DEX. Market determines price based on time to maturity.

4️⃣ **April 2026: Global Harvest**
Vault claims all fNFTs at 0% penalty burn. Perfect 1:1 backing achieved.

5️⃣ **Redeem 1:1 (Optional)**
Burn vS tokens, receive S tokens at exactly 1:1 ratio (minus 2% redeem fee).
*Your 990 vS → 970 S back*
